1. Document Object:

The document object represents the web page itself, or more specifically, the HTML document that is currently loaded in the browser.

It provides access to the content of the web page, allowing you to manipulate and interact with the HTML, such as modifying elements, changing text, or adding/removing elements.

You can access elements within the HTML document using various methods and properties of the document object, such as getElementById(), querySelector(), getElementsByTagName(), etc.



Example:

const element = document.getElementById("myElement");



2. window Object:

The window object represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded.

It provides access to the browser's properties and methods, allowing you to control and interact with the browser itself, rather than just the content of the web page.

You can use the window object to perform actions like opening new browser windows or tabs, resizing the window, navigating to different URLs, setting timeouts/intervals for functions to run, and accessing browser-specific information.


Example:

// Open a new browser window
window.open("https://www.example.com");
